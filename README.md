# ServiceSpot Call Center Analysis - Power BI Project

## Overview
ServiceSpot, an IT company, sought to analyze its call center data to improve efficiency and gain actionable insights. The data was fragmented across multiple files, making it difficult to extract meaningful insights. This project provides a complete Power BI solution to streamline data analysis and visualization.

## Project Goals
- Retrieve and integrate data from multiple sources.
- Apply necessary transformations using Power Query.
- Design a structured and efficient data model.
- Create relevant measures to address key business questions.
- Develop a visually appealing and interactive Power BI report.

## Key Business Questions Addressed
1. Percentage of calls answered within the Service Level Agreement (SLA) per employee.
2. Average call duration per employee.
3. Managers whose teams handle the most calls.
4. Average waiting time segmented by time of day:
   - Early morning (6 AM – 9 AM)
   - Late morning (9 AM – 12 PM)
   - Early afternoon (12 PM – 3 PM)
   - Late afternoon (3 PM – 6 PM)
   - Evening (6 PM – 9 PM)
5. Revenue generation by state.
6. Most and least busy days of the week in terms of call volume.
7. Average time before a customer abandons a call for each call type.

## Implementation Approach
- **Data Transformation:** Utilized Power Query to clean and transform raw data.
- **Data Modeling:** Implemented a star schema with a single fact table to optimize performance.
- **Measure Creation:** Developed DAX measures to compute key metrics such as SLA compliance, call durations, and revenue distribution.
- **Visual Design:** Designed an engaging report layout, ensuring an intuitive navigation experience.
- **Best Practices:** Followed Power BI best practices, such as separating date and time dimensions, structuring visual elements effectively, and ensuring a seamless user experience.

## Key Outcomes
- A fully interactive Power BI report enabling ServiceSpot to monitor call center performance efficiently.
- Improved visibility into SLA compliance, agent performance, and customer wait times.
- Actionable insights for managers to enhance workforce efficiency and optimize operations.
- Clear and structured data model that facilitates scalability and further analysis.
